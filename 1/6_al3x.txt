; SICP Exercise 1.6 (problem statement abbreviated)
;
; A new version of if is defined in Scheme, without being implemented as a special form.
; What happens when used to compute square roots using the sqrt-iter and related procedures
; from earlier in the text?

The program will loop infinitely, as in Exercise 1.5. Applicative-order evaluation means that
the recursive call to sqrt-iter will never return.

See associated 6_al3x.scm file to verify in the Scheme interpreter of your choice.
