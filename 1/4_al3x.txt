;; SICP Exercise 1.4
;;
;; Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators
;; are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of
;; the following procedure:
;;
;; (define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
;;   (if (> b 0) + -) a b))

This procedure adds a number and the absolute value of a second number.
In the case that the second number, b, is greater than 0, the addition operator will be invoked.
In the case that b is less than zero, the subtraction operator will be invoked.

So, both of the following will have a result of 3:

  (a-plus-abs-b 1 2)
  (a-plus-abs-b 1 -2)
