With applicative-order evaluation, on calling (test 0 (p)) you get:
(if (= x 0)
     0
         (p))

  Then you'd evaluate the if statement to 0. With normal-order evaluation, the operator and operands are evaluated sooner rather than later, and in attempting to expand (p) we get stuck in an infinite loop.
