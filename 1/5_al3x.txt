;; SICP Exercise 1.5 (problem statement abbreviated)
;;
;;
;; Two procedures are defined to test whether the interpreter is applicative-order or normal-order:
;;
;; (define (p) (p))
;;
;; (define (test x y)
;;   (if (= x 0)
;;   0
;;   y))
;;
;; And evaluated as:
;;
;; (test 0 (p))
;;
;; What happens under applicative-order and normal-order evaluations?

Under applicative-order evaluation, the interpreter loops infinitely on p.

A normal-order interpreter would substitute x with 0, evaluate the equality of 0 and 0 as true, and return 0. It would never reach the alternate branch of the conditional, and thus never reach the infinite loop.
